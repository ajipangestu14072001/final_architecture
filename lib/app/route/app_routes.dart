/// [AppRoutes Class]
/// Definition: A class that organizes and manages application routes.
/// Purpose: Centralizes route definitions and their associated bindings for an application, facilitating navigation and dependency injection with GetX.
/// [getPages Method]
/// Definition: A static method that returns a list of GetPage objects.
/// - Returns: List<GetPage> â€” a list of route definitions used by GetX for navigation.
/// Purpose: Provides a centralized location to define all the routes for the application. Each route is associated with a page and its corresponding binding.
/// [GetPage Instances]
/// Each GetPage instance defines a route in the application.
/// - name: The route name, which should match the string used for navigation.
/// - page: A callback function returning the widget that should be displayed for this route. The widget is usually a screen or view in the application.
/// - binding: An instance of the binding class associated with the route. This class is used for dependency injection and ensures that required dependencies are initialized before the route is displayed.
